# Pac-Man 
### Written using Javascript, HTML and CSS :sparkles:

I was bored during my Mid-Term Exams and thought of building a game to pass time... (don't worry, I finished studying 😁)

In this game, Pac-Man moves around the grid while avoiding walls, I have given the Constructor Method for all four ghosts to apply their unique characterisitcs to each one, including at what speed they move at. Clyde obviously being the slowest. 😂😁

I thought of building Pac-Man. I went to YouTube and looked up 'Pac-Man built using Javascript' and stumbled upon <a href ='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUGlSl2i4Q&feature=emb_title'> Ania Kubow's Video </a> on building Pac-Man :bowtie: 

Her video was really helpful and I learnt many inbuilt JavaScript Functions that I never knew **existed**
