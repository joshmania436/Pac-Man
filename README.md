# Pac-Man 
### Written using Javascript, HTML and CSS :sparkles:

In this game, Pac-Man moves around the grid while avoiding walls, I have given the Constructor Method for all four ghosts to apply their unique characterisitcs to each one, including at what speed they move at. Clyde obviously being the slowest. 😂😁
